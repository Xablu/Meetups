## Contents

This repo contains the following content:

1. The [slides](https://github.com/Xablu/Meetups/blob/master/02%20MvvmCross%20Custom%20Bindings/MvvmCross%20-%20Custom%20Bindings.pptx) used during my presentation on Custom Binding with MvvmCross during the Xablu meetups;
2. The sample source code used in the live demo. The source code is split in the following folder:
  - "[start](https://github.com/Xablu/Meetups/tree/master/02%20MvvmCross%20Custom%20Bindings/start/CustomBinding)": this is the project I start with in the live demo. It contains the custom control but binding is not yet setup. Use this project when you want to replay the presentation for your self and practise building custom binding.
  - "[final](https://github.com/Xablu/Meetups/tree/master/02%20MvvmCross%20Custom%20Bindings/final/CustomBinding)": this is the final version of the project at the end of the live demo. It contains the full application including the bindings. Use this if you would like to look back on how to implement your own custom binding.
